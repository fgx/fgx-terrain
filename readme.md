==============================================================================

Live Demo (using a JavaScript viewer): [FGx Terrain Viewer JS]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-terrain-viewer-js/index.html "Happy viewing!" )

- very preliminary


## Concept
### Mission
Provide 3D terrain elevation data for the entire earth at 90 meter intervals - freely and easily accesible even to new and intermediate programmers.

###Vision
Develop demos and utilities that use the 3D data in clever ways for all the major coding languages.


## Notes
This repo currently contains every folder and file required to display heightmaps for Slippy Map levels 0 to 7.

Currently the folders contain height maps only up to level 2 - after that there is merely a dummy image of the FGx cap.

## Reference
The [bitmaps]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap ) ( or images, [raster graphics]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics ) ) described here are of a special form.
each pixel designates an altitude above or bellow or equal to a datum.
