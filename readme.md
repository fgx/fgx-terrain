==============================================================================

Live Demo: [FGx Terrain Viewer JS]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-terrain-viewer-js/index.html "Happ viewing!" )

- very preliminary


## Concept
3D terrain elevation data for the entire earth at 90 meter intervals - freely and easily accesible even to new and intermediate programmers

## Notes
This repo contains every folder and file required to display heitmaps fr Slippy Mak levels 0 to 7.

Currently the bitmaps contain no actual height maps - merely a dummy image of the FGx cap.
